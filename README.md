### Authentication

#### Register a new user

```
POST /api/v1/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123"
}
```

#### Login

```
POST /api/v1/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "email": "john@example.com",

}
```

Response will include an authentication token:

```
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Logged in successfully",
    "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
